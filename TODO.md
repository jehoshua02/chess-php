# TODO

+ Profile to look for optimization

### Check / Checkmate / Stalemate

+ Piece->checkmate(): no possible moves for any piece

+ Stalemate (not in check but has no possible moves)

### Castling

+ King should be able to castle
+ King should not be able to castle
+ King cannot castle when in check

## King

+ King should have no possible moves
+ King should have one possible move
+ King should have two possible moves
+ King should have three possible moves
+ King should have four possible moves
+ King should have five possible moves
+ King should have six possible moves
+ King should have seven possible moves
+ King should have eight possible moves: up, down, left, right, upLeft, upRight, downLeft, downRight



## General

+ King, Queen, Bishop, Knight, Rook
+ Movement history (at least enough to support capture en passant)
+ Pawn should be able to capture en passant
+ Game Runner/Engine (encapsulates board, pieces, players, turn order, history, etc, whatever, the "glue" of it all)
+ Presentation layer?
