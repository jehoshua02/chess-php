# TODO

+ Pawn: Capture En Passant
    + Pawn should be able to capture en passant
        + Pawn of different color to right or left
        + Pawn to right or left just moved two spaces
    + Pawn should be removed from board after capture en passant

+ Profile to look for optimization
+ Game Runner/Engine (encapsulates board, pieces, players, turn order, history, etc, whatever, the "glue" of it all)
+ Presentation layer?
+ NPC/AI
