# TODO

+ King castling: cannot castle *into* check
+ Pawn: Capture En Passant
    + Pawn of different color on same rank and neighboring pawn move two spaces in previous move

+ Profile to look for optimization
+ Game Runner/Engine (encapsulates board, pieces, players, turn order, history, etc, whatever, the "glue" of it all)
+ Presentation layer?
+ NPC/AI
